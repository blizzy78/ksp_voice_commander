1.2.0, 2014-05-17
- Added new commands. See http://bit.ly/1lnCdEv for a complete list.
- Added optional push-to-talk: Press a key on your keyboard, mouse, or joystick to enable
  listening only temporarily.
- The last command recognized will now be displayed in the game for a few seconds (along with
  an indication of recognition confidence.)
- Fixed a bug where multiple alternate texts for a command were not accepted correctly.

1.1.1, 2014-05-13
- Fixed a bug where the texts for "Apoapsis" and "Periapsis" were not saved correctly.
- Recompiled VoiceCommanderMechJeb.dll using a newer version of MechJeb. This will prevent
  KSP from crashing should an updated version of MechJeb be installed.
  Note that you must use MechJeb 2.2.1 development build 255 or newer.

1.1.0, 2014-05-12
- Added new commands. See http://bit.ly/1lnCdEv for a complete list.
- Added a macro mechanism to avoid having lots of similar commands. You can now say, "yaw + 10"
  or "roll - 90" to rotate about the specified axes, all using a single command (and therefore
  the same syntax.) Note that the actual syntax is still up to you - it could also be as lengthy
  as "rotate about the roll axis by - 90 degrees".

1.0.0, 2014-05-11
- Initial public release.
