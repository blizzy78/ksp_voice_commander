1.1.0, 2014-05-12
- Added new commands. See http://bit.ly/1lnCdEv for a complete list.
- Added a macro mechanism to avoid having lots of similar commands. You can now say, "yaw + 10"
  or "roll - 90" to rotate about the specified axes, all using a single command (and therefore
  the same syntax.) Note that the actual syntax is still up to you - it could also be as lengthy
  as "rotate about the roll axis by - 90 degrees".

1.0.0, 2014-05-11
- Initial public release.
